# Solar-flare-prediction

The focus of this project is to treat the imbalanced data with the use of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to increase the number of observations of flare occurrences and decrease the number of non-occurrences using K-means clustering.
The new data shall then be fitted with a logistic regression and then judged based on Learning curve and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve
